COMP 412, Fall 2014
Timer for lab 1

To run the timer, you must unpack the tar file into a clean directory, which 
should leave behind a series of input files, named T*k.i, and an executable
file, named Timer.

Timer takes a single command-line parameter, the pathname of your allocator.  
Test the pathname by typing it into a shell; that will reveal some problems.  
For example, my shell path does not include ".", so I would need to use 
the filename "./412alloc" instead of "412alloc".

To test "myalloc", I would type:

   ./Timer ./myalloc

In response, the timer would first run the reference allocator on the input
files and report the amount of time that it consumes.  Next, it would run
the allocator "./myalloc" on the same files, reporting the amount of time
that "./myalloc" consumed on each of the input files.

The timer will exit if any individual run exceeds five minutes (300 seconds).
If you see that behavior, it is a strong indicator that your lab contains 
one or more algorithms that have complexity greater than O(n). You should 
invest time to find those components and improve or replace them.

Note that ./Timer runs the lab 1 referencec allocator with the -c option, 
which turns off its extensive comment generation.  Comment generation accounts
for about 1/3 of the reference allocator's runtime.
